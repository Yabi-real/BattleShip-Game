<h1> Battle Ship Game ! </h1>

This code is completely in C# and it is a game where you play against a CPU and try to get all the ships you possibly can. As of now I haven't 
created the part where the user can implement his own ships and the the CPU can attack him or her but I will soon. In this program you can select a
row and a column to directly hit the the enemies battleships. If you hit there will be and X but if you miss ther will be an O. There is also a cheat
mode where you can see the CPU's battleships.


<h1>future Upgrades</h1>

I'm hoping to update it where the user can implement his own ships and the CPU can attack when a turn has been played. Maybe also make this a Co-op where
others can play.
